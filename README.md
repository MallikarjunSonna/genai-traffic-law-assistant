# 🚦 GenAI-Powered Indian Traffic Law Assistant

This is a simple yet effective Streamlit-based GenAI app that helps users query Indian traffic laws in natural language. It uses LangChain, OpenAI embeddings, and FAISS for intelligent search from a PDF version of the Motor Vehicles Act.

##  What This Project Does

- Loads traffic law PDF using PyPDF2.
- Splits the content into chunks using LangChain’s `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`.
- Embeds those chunks using OpenAI embeddings.
- Stores the vectors in a FAISS vector database.
- Creates a retriever + LLM chain to give context-aware answers.
- Runs everything on a simple Streamlit UI.

##  How to Run This Project

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MallikarjunSonna/genai-traffic-law-assistant.git
cd genai-traffic-law-assistant
```

### 2. Install Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Add Your API Key

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your OpenAI key like this:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key
```

Refer to `.env.example` for reference.

### 4. Run the App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

That’s it — now you can ask questions from Indian traffic law like a pro.
